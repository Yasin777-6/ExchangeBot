# üö® Fix Railway 502 Error - Step by Step

## Problem: App Won't Start on Railway

Your app is getting 502 errors because Railway can't start it. This is **99% because environment variables are not set**.

---

## üîß Solution: Set Environment Variables in Railway

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your project
3. Click **"New"** ‚Üí **"Database"** ‚Üí **"PostgreSQL"**
4. Wait for it to deploy (this auto-creates `DATABASE_URL`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

1. Click on your **web service** (not the database)
2. Click **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"+ New Variable"**
4. Add these **ONE BY ONE**:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8400316541:AAH6TWxxscPwulDlWJ1ZNDP5dCHBR4FwSXM
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app,*.up.railway.app
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://exchangebot-production-8f2a.up.railway.app
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-hb#tn8+hw6j4o(dh#nze9%b$^!ii*k9nhhqps1x+mpis7ps*u)
```

**IMPORTANT:** 
- `DATABASE_URL` should appear automatically after adding PostgreSQL
- If not, reconnect the database to the service

### Step 3: Redeploy

After setting variables:
- Railway will **automatically redeploy**
- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### Step 4: Check Deployment

1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click latest deployment
3. View **"Deploy Logs"**

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Deployment successful"
- ‚ùå Any error messages

## üîç Verify It Works

### Test 1: Home Page
Visit: https://exchangebot-production-8f2a.up.railway.app/

**Expected:** JSON response with endpoints

### Test 2: Health Check
Visit: https://exchangebot-production-8f2a.up.railway.app/health/

**Expected:** "OK"

### Test 3: Admin
Visit: https://exchangebot-production-8f2a.up.railway.app/admin/

**Expected:** Django admin login page

---

## üêõ Still Not Working?

### Check Railway Logs

1. Go to service ‚Üí **"Deployments"**
2. Click latest deployment
3. Look at **"Deploy Logs"** and **"Build Logs"**

### Common Errors:

#### Error: "No module named 'psycopg2'"
**Fix:** Already in requirements.txt, just redeploy

#### Error: "FATAL: password authentication failed"
**Fix:** 
- Delete and recreate PostgreSQL database
- Or check DATABASE_URL is correct

#### Error: "Missing environment variable"
**Fix:** Go back to Step 2 and set all variables

#### Error: "Port already in use"
**Fix:** Railway sets PORT automatically, don't override it

---

## ‚úÖ After It Works

### 1. Run Migrations (via Railway CLI or Shell)
```bash
railway run python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Create Superuser
```bash
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 3. Create Bot Admin
```bash
railway run python manage.py shell
```

Then:
```python
from bot.models import TelegramUser, UserRole
admin = TelegramUser.objects.create(
    telegram_id=YOUR_TELEGRAM_ID,
    username='admin',
    role=UserRole.ADMIN
)
print("Admin created!")
```

### 4. Set Webhook
Visit: https://exchangebot-production-8f2a.up.railway.app/bot/set-webhook/

### 5. Test Bot
Send `/start` to your bot in Telegram!

## üìã Environment Variables Checklist

In Railway Variables tab, you should see:

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (auto-created by PostgreSQL)
- [ ] `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` 
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] `DEBUG=False`
- [ ] `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- [ ] `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
- [ ] `PORT` (auto-provided by Railway, don't set manually)

---

## üéØ Quick Debug Commands

If you have Railway CLI installed:

```bash
# Check environment variables
railway run python check_env.py

# Test Django startup
railway run python test_startup.py

# View logs
railway logs

# Open shell
railway shell
```

---

## üí° Important Notes

1. **Local `.env` is NOT used on Railway** - You MUST set variables in dashboard
2. **Variables are case-sensitive** - Use exact names as shown
3. **Changes trigger redeploy** - Wait for it to complete
4. **DATABASE_URL is auto-provided** - Don't set it manually if PostgreSQL is connected

## üöÄ Success Indicators

When everything works:
- ‚úÖ Home page shows JSON
- ‚úÖ Admin page loads
- ‚úÖ No 502 errors
- ‚úÖ Logs show "Deployment successful"
- ‚úÖ Bot responds to `/start`

Good luck! üéâ
